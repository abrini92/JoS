# 🚀 JarvisOS - Operating System Roadmap

## Vision

**Transform from Python scripts → Full standalone operating system**

---

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### What We Have (Week 1)
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Host OS       │ ← macOS/Linux
├─────────────────┤
│ Python Scripts  │ ← JarvisOS (current)
│ - Observer      │
│ - Analyzer      │
│ - Generator     │
│ - Executor      │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Status:** Intelligence engine works, but runs ON another OS

---

## Phase 2: System Integration (Weeks 2-4)

### Goal
Make JarvisOS run as **system-level services** that start at boot

### Tasks

- [x] Deployment documentation
- [ ] Test on Ubuntu VM
- [ ] Test on Arch Linux
- [ ] Auto-start on boot
- [ ] Background daemon mode
- [ ] Nightly evolution timer

### Deliverable
```bash
# JarvisOS runs as OS service

...
Night 30: Completely personalized OS
```

**Result:** OS that evolves uniquely for each user

---

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current (Phase 1)
```python
# Python scripts
jarvis.py observe
jarvis.py analyze
jarvis.py generate
```

### Phase 2 (System Services)
```bash
# Systemd services
systemctl start jarvisos-observer
systemctl enable jarvisos-nightly.timer
```

### Phase 3 (Custom OS)
```
Boot → JarvisOS Init → Observer Daemon → Desktop
```

### Phase 4 (Self-Building)
```
Night: Analyze → Generate → Test → Rebuild → Reboot
Morning: New optimized OS
```

### Phase 5 (Distributed)
```
Local OS ←→ Community Gene Pool ←→ Other Users
         ↓
    Best patterns propagate
```

## Philosophy

### Not Just an OS
JarvisOS is:
- **Living:** Evolves every night
- **Personal:** Unique to each user
- **Intelligent:** Learns from behavior
- **Free:** Open source, no backdoors
- **Sovereign:** You own it completely

### Different from Traditional OS
| Traditional OS | JarvisOS |
|---------------|----------|
| Static | Evolving |
| Same for everyone | Unique per user |
| Manual configuration | Auto-optimizes |
| Closed source | Open source |
| Vendor-controlled | User-owned |

---

**We're building the future of computing.** 🚀

One phase at a time.
One night at a time.
One user at a time.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress

**Next Milestone:** System service running on Linux VM
