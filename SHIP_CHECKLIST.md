## üìã LAUNCH POSTS

### Reddit (r/selfhosted)

```markdown
**JarvisOS - Simple AI OS with local Ollama (1-line install)**

After seeing OpenDAN's 30-step setup, I built something simpler:

‚úÖ Install: curl | bash (15 min)
‚úÖ AI: Ollama (local, free, privacy)
‚úÖ Learning: Observes behavior
‚úÖ Voice: Jarvis speaks!

Not trying to be the most powerful AI OS.
Just the easiest to use.

GitHub: [link]
Demo: [link]

Feedback welcome!
```

### HackerNews

```markdown
Show HN: JarvisOS - Simple AI OS (Ollama, 1-line install, privacy-first)

I got frustrated with complex AI Operating Systems (OpenDAN requires 30+ steps, AIOS needs research papers to understand).

So I built JarvisOS:
- Install: curl -sSL [url] | bash
- Done in 15 minutes
- 100% local with Ollama
- No API keys, no cloud
- Learns your behavior
- Voice interface

Tech: Python, Ollama (llama3.2), Plymouth boot, systemd

It's not the most powerful AI OS. But it works out of the box.

Happy to answer questions!

GitHub: [link]
Demo: [video]
```

### r/LocalLLaMA

```markdown
**Built an AI OS around Ollama - feedback wanted**

JarvisOS: Privacy-first AI assistant that learns from you

Features:
- Ollama integration (llama3.2)
- Behavior observation & learning
- Script generation
- Voice interface
- Boot customization

Install in 1 command, 100% local, no cloud.

Looking for feedback from the LocalLLaMA community!
